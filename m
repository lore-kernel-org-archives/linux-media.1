I would maybe agree iff the RCU read side critical section wouldn't be need=
ed
and we wouldn't need to deal with the consequences of having to defer
everything.

And so far it seems to me that there isn't really any other reason that the
performance concern we both don't buy into.

In general, I don't think that more flexibility for drivers is automaticall=
y
always superior.

Also, before we keep calling it a performance issue, I'd really love to kno=
w
where dma_fence_is_signaled() is called in a case where it returns false an=
d the
spinlock causes such an overhead that it actually matters.

(As mentioned above, none of the cases where it returns true would change.)

I don't think this is true in this case.

  1) The existence of dma_fence_is_signaled_locked() already mandates that =
all
     such callbacks must work properly if called with the fence lock held.

  2) The RCU read side critical section already mandates that driver must n=
ot
     sleep within the callback.

That's practically already the case, due to dma_fence_is_signaled_locked().
