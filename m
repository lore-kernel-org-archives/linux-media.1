Document the devicetree binding for the ITE IT6625/IT6626 HDMI to
MIPI CSI-2 bridge. The device exposes two graph ports: port@0
(MIPI0) and port@1 (MIPI1), the two selectable CSI-2 D-PHY/C-PHY
outputs. Only port@0 is required, since a board only needs to wire up
as many of the bridge's outputs as it actually uses.

Changes in v8:
- Drop the redundant trailing "binding" from the subject -- the
  "dt-bindings:" prefix already says so.
- Use a bare "description:" (no block-scalar indicator) instead of
  "description: |-", matching the dominant in-tree style and
  adi,adv748x.yaml's own multi-line description.
- Drop the bare "clock-noncontinuous: true" / "link-frequencies: true"
  entries under port@0/port@1 endpoints: they add no constraint beyond
  what video-interfaces.yaml already allows via $ref.
- Add the missing blank line between the ports.required block and the
  top-level required list.
- Drop the allOf branch forcing port@0/port@1 endpoint
  bus-type = const 4 for "ite,it6625": that value is already implied
  by compatible, so asserting it again in the schema added nothing.
  The "ite,it6626" branch requiring bus-type is unaffected.
- Document interrupts (optional) and the vcc10-supply/vdd33-supply/
  ovdd-supply power rails (required), and extend the example with
  all three plus the previously-missing port@2 node.
All found by Krzysztof Kozlowski's on-list review of v7.

Changes in v7:
- Add back port@2 for the HDMI input port, reversing the v4 decision
  to drop it. The v6 automated review re-raised the same concern with
  stronger footing than v3's: devicetree describes the physical
  hardware independent of what a given driver consumes, and the chip
  has a physical HDMI input regardless of whether it6625.c wires
  anything to it. Checked against adi,adv7604.yaml, an
  actively-maintained upstream binding for a comparable HDMI-receiver
  chip, which documents its input port(s) the same way via
  graph.yaml's generic port pattern -- concrete precedent that an
  input port unused by the driver still belongs in the schema.
  Verified port@2 stays optional and the schema still validates with
  dt-doc-validate/dt-validate both with and without it present.

Changes in v6:
- Unchanged. The v5 automated review flagged that the it6626
  conditional's `required: [bus-type]` constraint, expressed under
  `properties: { endpoint: {...} }`, doesn't match an `endpoint@N`
  unit-addressed node and could in principle be bypassed. Checked
  against mipi-ccs.yaml, an actively-maintained upstream binding that
  requires bus-type (among other properties) via the exact same
  `properties.endpoint.required` idiom with no patternProperties --
  direct evidence this is accepted convention, not a defect, so no
  fix was made.

Changes in v4:
- Drop port@2 (the HDMI connector input graph port) entirely: it
  added no constraints beyond graph.yaml's generic endpoint-base, and
  the driver doesn't use this graph port for anything schema-relevant,
  so there was nothing for a consumer devicetree to usefully validate
  against it. Found by the automated review of v3, which suggested
  adding it to `required` instead -- dropping it entirely was judged
  the better fix since the port carried no real constraints to begin
  with.
- Require bus-type on port@0/port@1 endpoints when compatible contains
  "ite,it6626": the driver defaults to D-PHY when bus-type is omitted,
  which is always correct for it6625 (D-PHY only) but would silently
  misconfigure an it6626 board actually wired for C-PHY. Also found by
  the automated review of v3.

One other v3 review finding was checked and is not being acted on:
- The plain `properties: { endpoint: {...} }` override used for each
  port technically doesn't reach graph.yaml's separate
  `patternProperties` matcher, so an `endpoint@0`-style node could in
  principle bypass the local data-lanes/bus-type constraints. This is
  the same convention already used by other single-endpoint-per-port
  bindings in-tree (e.g. thine,thp7312.yaml), not a defect unique to
  this binding.

Changes in v2:
- Restrict port@0/port@1 endpoint bus-type to D-PHY (4) only when
  compatible is "ite,it6625", via an allOf/if/then constraint. IT6625
  only supports MIPI CSI-2 D-PHY output; the schema previously allowed
  both C-PHY (1) and D-PHY (4) unconditionally, so a devicetree
  claiming "ite,it6625" with bus-type = C-PHY passed schema validation
  despite being invalid on that hardware. IT6626, which supports both
  PHY types, is unaffected. Found by the sashiko.dev automated review
  of v1.

+description:
+  The ITE IT6625 and IT6626 are HDMI to MIPI CSI-2 bridge devices.
+  IT6625 supports an HDMI 2.0 input and converts it to one or two D-PHY CSI
+  outputs, while IT6626 supports an HDMI 2.1 input and converts it to one or
+  two C/D-PHY CSI outputs. The bridges are programmable through I2C and
+  expose two selectable CSI-2 output ports and an HDMI input port. The
+  bridge can operate in split mode or clone mode.
