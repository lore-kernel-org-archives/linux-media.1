I certainly agree with you that this is a large problem. I don't think
we have a single problem though, but I can understand people who
consider the problem you're discribing as more urgent to address.

We're enabling bots on mailing lists that people are already subscribed
to. But I don't think that's a very important argument here.

That I strongly disagree with. A humain reviewer sending a review with
dozens of nits usually doesn't annoy me, and doesn't make me feel
diminished as a human.

We disagree on this as well. This would force contributors to constantly
justify their value against a machine that is known to produce a
non-negligible quantity of nonsense. Furthermore, if those generative AI
tools are as good as their supporters claim, the time they free for
maintainers should outweight the need workload to triage the comments.
