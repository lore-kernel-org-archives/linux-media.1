That's not exactly true. There are protocol differences. For example,
polling mode is supported only since a certain timeline in the history.
Likewise other interface features are not supported on all the FastRPC
devices. For the polling mode support we were already beaten by the lack
of SoC-specific compats.

This is clear.

I think the general direction was #3 (or #2.1): implement a shim layer
on top of the QDA driver as a separate module. Put all the historical
over-complicated solutions into that shim module and let it die at some
point. Current fastrpc driver lets userspace specify buffers in several
different ways, forcing the kernel driver to perform a lot of work
with buffer addresses. I don't think that this legacy code should be a
part of the QDA. It can go to qda-fastrpc-shim, keeping it out of the
kernel memory if it's not necessary.

I agree that it should be a part of the cover letter.

As a person who triggered this work, I can propose my reasons:

- Current driver has over-complicated memory manager (both on the
  userspace and on the kernel side). Correspondng uAPI is not really
  suitable for virtualization. Using GEM simplifies both the kernel
  driver and uAPI. Also using handle-offset-length to specify the
  buffers makes it easy to support virtual QDA devices.

- Current driver predates the accel subsystem. Using common subsystem
  simplifies reviews. The QDA driver has gotten several comments about
  the usage of the DMA-BUFs. It'not unlikely that the same issues are
  present in the current FastRPC driver, just being unnoticed.

- The ideas present in the current FastRPC driver also predate the
  current design practices. The uAPI was created in the ad-hoc way, just
  following the momentary needs. Driver code also shows the result of
  that, having enough of the spaghetti code.

Given all of that, yes, it is possible to provide an evolution of the
FastRPC driver into the accel+shim, improve the code quality meanwhile
and end up with the good enough split. However I think that the path
taken would be longer and the net result might be worse.

With all of that in mind, my suggestion is to continue working on the
QDA driver, get the core of it to integrate nicely with the accel and
DMA-BUF usage requirements and implement the (minimal?) fastrpc shim on
top of it.
