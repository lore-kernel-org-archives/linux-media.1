I'm not saying that you're saying that. I'm just cautioning you that
this change could be tricky.

You can't use sleepable locks in fences. They fire in interrupt context
left and right ;)

Despite, that wouldn't even solve the reported problem.

The tl;dr is:

there is fence_ops->enable_signaling(), which is currently being called
with the fence lock held. So the driver, in that callback, cannot take
a driver-specific lock IF there is another driver party (like an IRQ)
taking first the driver lock and then the fence lock.

Which is why Christian K=C3=B6nig wants to remove the fence lock being held
in enable_signaling().

One reason why that, supposedly, is currently not a problem is that
without fence->inline_lock, you can protect the fctx with the same lock
and do fctx list manipulations in enable_signaling() with lock
protection.


If you have a big bowl of popcorn available, you could checkout this
thread:

https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20260608142436.265820-2-phasta@kernel.org=
/

;p

My own thinking is:
If everyone used inline_lock, and if we could rely on everyone being
able to do the necessary work in enable_signaling() without said lock-
inversion, then we could perfectly synchronize all actions related to
dma_fence, including driver and, thus, fence_ops unload.

The only thing blocking really might be enable_signaling (the other
callbacks already take the lock). The more difficult question would be
how to implement that in a backwards compatible manner, i.e., for those
who don't have inline_lock.

Another idea for the distant future might be to question the existence
of those callbacks. Userspace often is sort of decoupled from the
hardware fences through intermediate fences already.

I am in support of that, which is why I posted that RFC for feedback
about the appropriate memory barriers.

You're welcome. If you'd find a clever solution, probably everyone
would be happy.
