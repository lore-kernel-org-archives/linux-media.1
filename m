Not that I'm aware of, as long as the driver follow the conventions. A typi=
cal
occurrence of this is when Sashiko suggest that you should do an extra work=
er
cancel after streamoff. The framework already ensure, through a job wait
mechanism, that there is no more active tasks. This allow chaining this wor=
k
across workers, and one really done with the task, the driver will call a
function to finish the job.

Though, AI is also fed with code using the framework, but not the jobs. Ven=
us
and Iris from Qualcomm just leave the job running, and manually tear down a=
nd
finish the job on streamoff. So when AI use that as example (or thinking mo=
del),
they conclude defensive coding is needed. I bet that if Qualcomm Iris/Venus
developer where to review other m2m they would provide similar reviews. But=
 they
will likely add words that show a certain level of uncertainty, very unlike
Sashiko today.

What happens is that developers endup producing defensive code for cases th=
at
will never occur, but it can go as far as refactoring and putting in place =
extra
mechanism that are simply duplicate of the existing framework. So we receiv=
e
more complex code, with convincing comment that does not reflect any real-l=
ife
scenarios.

Now its not a great mechanism, since its easy to "finish the job" and keep
working, which can make the driver code run concurrently with a device_run(=
)
from another thread. And for multi-core drivers, its easy to forget that th=
e
framework does not protect anything concurrent inside your driver.

Sashiko is just not doing the teaching that is needed for new contributors,=
 or
for experienced developers handling slightly different type of HW with this
"problematic" framework. So if someone up for designing something better an=
d
porting bunch of drivers, that person is very welcome!

I believe this have to start as a case by case. Perhaps if we could mark an=
d tag
these on the web UI, and once we have a good collection we might be able to=
 see
clearly. At the minute, its very all over the place, since we are getting s=
ome
patch witch don't always cross-reference the reports, or may be reviewed by
other AI. Its all very unclear and variable where and how the issue was
identified in the first place. What we get is code, and sometimes wall of t=
ext.
We need to organize ourself a bit more and have clear communication in this
regard.

For the teaching aspect, that is too complicated for AI at the moment. You =
want
this toned based on the submitter experience. There is judgment to be made.

With AI, I also keep a reserve on how much effort I put to fix things like =
that,
as the models evolve really fast, this work might not be required in the ne=
xt
update.
