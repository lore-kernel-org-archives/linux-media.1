My objection is to a suggested expectation for every review to be
triaged by maintainers/reviewers *before* it's sent or the author
engages with it.

I think the author should be the first one to engage, it's a feedback
on their patch after all. And of course reviewers/maintainers are free
to jump in whenever they can and feel it's necessary, and they do. Opt-in.

Yes, this is a valid point. I'm not arguing automated AI feedback is
always good. This is why the triage is needed in the first place.

I think one small thing that may help with this is teaching
contributors to not iterate on the revisions too quickly based solely
on AI feedback. And also try to iterate with AI reviews off-list first.

But that's marginal. Fundamentally, a human has to read AI feedback on
the patch in the end. I don't see a way around it, barring the singularity™.
