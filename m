Add a V4L2 subdevice driver for the ITE IT6625/IT6626 HDMI-to-MIPI
CSI-2 bridge chips. IT6625 accepts an HDMI 2.0 input and IT6626 an
HDMI 2.1 input, converting it to a D-PHY (or C/D-PHY on IT6626)
MIPI CSI-2 output. The bridge is configured over I2C, exposes an
HDMI CEC adapter, and supports EDID read/write, DV timings
detection/configuration, and HPD control via the standard V4L2
subdevice pad and video ops.

Changes in v9:
- Change it6625_interrupt_handler() to return bool and
  it6625_irq_handler() to translate that into IRQ_HANDLED/IRQ_NONE:
  the handler returned early without clearing REG_MCU_INTERRUPT
  whenever the read was spurious (val == 0) or failed (val < 0), yet
  the IRQ handler unconditionally returned IRQ_HANDLED. On that path
  no IT6625 interrupt source was observed for this invocation, so
  always reporting IRQ_HANDLED regardless defeats the kernel's
  spurious-IRQ storm protection, which relies on IRQ_NONE to identify
  and disable misbehaving lines. Matches the pattern already used by
  tc358743.c and adv7604.c. Found by the sashiko.dev automated review
  of v8.
- Take it6625_lock in it6625_initial_setup(): it wrote
  B_CONFIG_UPDATE to REG_HOST_CTRL_INT and polled for it to clear
  without holding the lock, but it runs from probe() after
  cec_register_adapter() has already exposed /dev/cecX to userspace,
  and it6625_cec_adap_transmit() (reachable immediately via a CEC
  ioctl) sets B_CEC_SEND_DATA in the same register under the lock.
  Every other accessor of REG_HOST_CTRL_INT already took the lock;
  this was the sole exception. Single call site, lock already
  initialized before it, so no deadlock is introduced. Found by the
  sashiko.dev automated review of v8.

One other v8 review finding was checked and is not being acted on:
- fps_from_bt_timings() computing
  V4L2_DV_BT_FRAME_HEIGHT(t) * V4L2_DV_BT_FRAME_WIDTH(t) as a 32-bit
  product, which the review claims can overflow to 0 given
  V4L2_DV_BT_CAP_CUSTOM's relaxed matching. Checked: it6625->timings,
  the only value this function is ever called on, is populated only
  by it6625_update_timings_if_changed(), which rejects anything
  failing v4l2_valid_dv_timings() against it6625_timings_cap (width
  640-3840, height 480-2160), or by a static default.
  v4l2_valid_dv_timings() additionally bounds every porch field
  (hfrontporch/hsync/hbackporch <= 3x width;
  vfrontporch/vsync/vbackporch/il_* <= 10240). Given those caps the
  maximum possible FRAME_WIDTH * FRAME_HEIGHT is
  38400 x 63600 ~= 2.44x10^9, safely under 2^32 ~= 4.29x10^9 -- the
  claimed overflow input is mathematically unreachable through this
  driver's validated timings path.

Changes in v8:
- Drop of_match_ptr() around it6625_of_match in the i2c_driver: the
  table is unconditionally compiled in, so wrapping it is unnecessary
  and risks an unused-variable warning on configs without CONFIG_OF.
  Found by Krzysztof Kozlowski's on-list review of v7.
- Stop halving bt->pixelclock for interlaced signals in
  it6625_get_detected_timings(). Checked against the IT6625 spec: for
  an interlaced source (e.g. 1080i) the chip's built-in MCU already
  reports REG_VID_PCLK as the correct, real pixel clock (74.25 MHz for
  1080i, not a half-rate/field clock), while the height it reports is
  the per-field active height (540), which the existing
  "bt->height *= 2" correctly turns into the true full-frame height.
  Dividing the already-correct pixel clock by 2 on top of that mangled
  it to 37.125 MHz, understating the reported frame rate by half.
  Found by the sashiko.dev automated review of v7. il_vfrontporch/
  il_vbackporch are still left unset for interlaced signals -- the
  IT6625 MCU has no separate second-field porch registers, so there's
  nothing to read for them; not fixed, since there's nothing to fix in
  software.

One other v7 review finding was checked and is not being acted on:
- it6625_get_fmt() unconditionally writes the live detected timings
  into format->format.width/height/field regardless of TRY vs ACTIVE,
  and it6625_set_fmt()'s TRY branch only persists code/colorspace into
  sd_state. This exactly matches tc358743_get_fmt()/tc358743_set_fmt()
  in tc358743.c, which never consult sd_state for width/height/field
  in either TRY or ACTIVE either. For this class of HDMI-receiver
  bridge, frame dimensions are dictated by the detected external
  signal, not independently negotiable via TRY -- only the pixel
  format (code/colorspace) is meaningfully TRY-isolatable, and that's
  exactly what both drivers isolate. Found by the sashiko.dev
  automated review of v7.

Also, per Krzysztof Kozlowski's on-list review: the it6625/it6626
of_device_id entries do encode a real behavioral difference --
it6625_parse_endpoint() rejects C-PHY endpoints unless
chip_type == IT6626_CHIP, so "ite,it6625" boards are correctly
restricted to D-PHY. Replying on-list to point this out, not a code
change.

Changes in v7:
- Fix three correctness issues found by the automated review of v6:
  it6625_parse_endpoint() left the fwnode endpoint's bus_type as
  V4L2_MBUS_UNKNOWN so v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_alloc_parse() could
  autodetect C-PHY vs D-PHY, but if the endpoint node has none of the
  CSI-2-specific properties, the parser silently falls back to
  V4L2_MBUS_PARALLEL/BT656 instead -- the driver then read
  endpoint.bus.mipi_csi2.num_data_lanes unconditionally, treating
  memory populated as a different union member as a lane count.
  it6625_set_fmt()'s V4L2_SUBDEV_FORMAT_ACTIVE branch applied the new
  format to hardware but never updated format->format.colorspace like
  the TRY branch does, so VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT callers got back the
  stale colorspace from before the call. it6625_s_edid() never
  checked edid->start_block, contrary to the VIDIOC_S_EDID spec
  (Documentation/userspace-api/media/v4l/vidioc-g-edid.rst), which
  requires -EINVAL for any start_block other than 0 since setting an
  EDID is all-or-nothing; added the same check already present in
  adv7604_s_edid(), tc358743_s_edid() and adv7842_s_edid() for the
  same requirement.

Changes in v6:
- Fix two correctness issues found by the automated review of v5:
  it6625_s_edid() called v4l2_phys_addr_validate() but discarded its
  return value, so a CEC physical address that failed topology
  validation (e.g. a gap like 1.0.1.0) still reached
  cec_s_phys_addr() and got broadcast on the CEC bus instead of being
  rejected; and it6625_parse_endpoint() pre-set the fwnode endpoint's
  bus_type to D-PHY before parsing, which (per
  include/media/v4l2-fwnode.h) makes the parser treat it as a hard
  requirement and reject any endpoint whose DT bus-type disagrees --
  every IT6626 C-PHY device tree failed to probe as a result.

One other v5 review finding was checked and is not being acted on:
- A concurrent VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_EDID ioctl racing it6625_remove()'s
  cancel_delayed_work_sync() could in principle schedule
  hpd_delayed_work after teardown frees the driver state. Real in the
  abstract -- no lock serializes an in-flight ioctl against
  video_unregister_device() -- but the identical unlocked pattern
  (delayed work scheduled from the s_edid path, remove() doing only
  cancel_delayed_work_sync()) exists unfixed in tc358743.c and
  adv7604.c, and this is the same residual risk already dismissed in
  the v2/v3/v4 rounds of this series for the same reason: no peer
  driver adds extra synchronization for it either.

Changes in v5:
- Fix a kernel-stack-memory leak in it6625_edid_ram_show() and
  it6625_mipi_reg_show(): both printed an uninitialized on-stack
  register buffer to userspace via debugfs without checking whether
  the preceding I2C bulk read actually succeeded.
- Fix two related format-negotiation bugs: it6625_set_fmt()'s
  V4L2_SUBDEV_FORMAT_TRY branch never updated fmt->colorspace to
  match the new fmt->code, and it6625_get_fmt()'s TRY branch computed
  the returned colorspace from the active hardware state instead of
  the TRY state's own format, leaking active state into what should
  be an isolated TRY buffer -- store and read code and colorspace
  together in sd_state instead. Separately, it6625_set_fmt()'s
  active-format path released it6625_lock before programming the
  hardware, letting two concurrent S_FMT calls interleave and leave
  the hardware programmed for the wrong thread's format; add _locked
  variants of it6625_enable_stream()/it6625_set_mipi_config() and call
  them from inside set_fmt()'s existing lock scope so the whole
  update is now atomic.
- Fix it6625_s_edid(): per the VIDIOC_S_EDID spec, blocks == 0 must
  leave the EDID disabled ("no longer available"), but the driver
  disabled HPD and then fell through to the normal completion path,
  which unconditionally re-enabled it -- return immediately instead.
  Also stop a failed it6625_write_edid() from skipping the HPD
  re-enable entirely, which left HPD disabled permanently after any
  single failed S_EDID call.
- Take it6625_lock around it6625_mipi_reg_write()'s I2C write,
  matching every other register access in the driver.
- Derive IT6625_CID_HDMI_INFO's string from real state
  (it6625->csi_format and fps_from_bt_timings()) instead of returning
  a hardcoded "RGB444 10bit @ 60Hz" regardless of actual signal.
- Wire up the previously-unused reset-gpios line in probe(): acquire
  it via devm_gpiod_get_optional() and toggle it (assert briefly, then
  deassert and let it settle) before the first I2C access.

All found by the sashiko.dev automated review of v4. Three other v4
review findings were checked and are not being acted on:
- it6625_mipi_reg_show()'s raw register dump could destructively
  consume a pending CEC RX message via REG_CEC_RX_DATA (0x20) --
  checked with the hardware author: reading REG_CEC_RX_DATA is not
  destructive, only the explicit write-0 to REG_CEC_RX_DATA_LEN
  clears state. The v4 changelog's "likely clear-on-read" assumption
  for this same register was wrong.
- devm_kzalloc'd state + subdev devnode UAF-in-the-abstract on unbind
  -- same reasoning as the v2/v3 rounds: matches tc358743.c/adv7604.c/
  adv7842.c exactly, an accepted V4L2-subsystem-wide pattern, not a
  defect unique to this driver.
- Concurrent VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_EDID racing it6625_remove()'s
  cancel_delayed_work_sync()/mutex_destroy() -- the same residual risk
  dismissed in the v3 round: real in the abstract, but no peer driver
  adds extra synchronization for it either, and the v2 round's fix
  (unregister the subdev first in remove()) already narrowed this to
  the same residual risk level every peer driver carries.

Changes in v4:
- Always acknowledge the CEC RX length register once the RX interrupt
  branch is entered, even when the reported length is invalid --
  previously the ack write only happened on valid lengths, so an
  invalid length left the interrupt asserted, which could storm the
  IRQ line.
- Fall back to a default format instead of returning -EINVAL from
  it6625_set_fmt() when the requested mbus code isn't recognized,
  matching the V4L2 subdev set_fmt convention (cf. adv7604.c). Take
  it6625_lock around it6625_get_fmt()'s ACTIVE-path reads of
  csi_format/mbus_fmt_code, which could otherwise observe a torn
  update from a concurrent set_fmt().
- Fix EDID ioctl spec conformance: it6625_g_edid() now clamps the
  requested block count and returns success instead of propagating an
  error when the request exceeds capacity; it6625_s_edid() now returns
  -E2BIG (not -EINVAL) with blocks set to the maximum, without
  attempting the write, when the request exceeds capacity; and
  it6625_read_edid()/it6625_write_edid()'s low-level bounds check now
  tests start_block and num_blocks individually before summing them,
  since the sum could otherwise overflow given the unsigned __u32
  fields of struct v4l2_edid.
- Harden the mipi_reg debugfs handlers: it6625_mipi_reg_write() now
  always parses from a local offset that starts at 0 instead of the
  real file offset, since this is a stateless one-write-one-command
  interface, not a seekable stream; it6625_mipi_reg_show() now takes
  it6625_lock around its raw register-bank read, matching every other
  banked-register access in the driver (the dumped range also includes
  REG_CEC_RX_DATA, which the CEC handler treats as clear-on-read, so an
  unlocked read could silently steal a pending CEC RX message).
- Mark the HDMI info control (IT6625_CID_HDMI_INFO) volatile:
  it6625_g_volatile_ctrl() already had a live case for it, but the
  control's v4l2_ctrl_config was missing V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_VOLATILE, so
  that case was never actually reached and the control's value was
  never refreshed.

All found by the sashiko.dev automated review of v3.

Separately, not a review finding: remove a redundant FW-start register
trigger from it6625_initial_setup() -- the chip's firmware starts
automatically on power-on, so the explicit software trigger was dead
weight.

Changes in v3:
- Finish the banked-register locking from v2: it6625_irq_infoframe_latch()
  and get_audio_sampling_rate() also read banked registers without
  it6625_lock; take the lock inside the CEC RX branch across the
  length read, data read and length-clear together (closing a TOCTOU
  where the length could go stale under lock contention), and stop the
  RX branch from using an early return that skipped a simultaneous CEC
  TX interrupt.
- Fix it6625_s_edid() incorrectly treating a successful EDID write as
  a failure: it6625_write_edid() returns a positive block count on
  success, not 0, so `if (err)` skipped the CEC phys-addr update and
  HPD re-enable on every successful write. Pre-existing since v1, not
  introduced by the v2 blocks==0 handling.
- Add real V4L2_SUBDEV_FORMAT_TRY support in get_fmt/set_fmt via
  sd_state, matching the pattern used by adv7604.c, and lock the
  csi_format/mbus_fmt_code commit in the ACTIVE path against
  concurrent S_FMT calls.
- Read the chip's real porch/sync-width registers
  (REG_H_FP_1..REG_V_BP_0) in it6625_get_detected_timings() instead of
  lumping the whole blanking interval into hsync/vsync, so detected
  timings can actually match the standard CEA/VESA tables.

All found by the sashiko.dev automated review of v2. Four other v2
review findings were checked against the code and are not being acted
on:
- "timer_container_of() doesn't exist" -- it does
  (include/linux/timer.h), the driver already builds clean with it.
- "devm_kzalloc'd state + subdev devnode risks a UAF on unbind" --
  true in the abstract, but it's the exact pattern used by every
  comparable in-tree driver (tc358743.c, adv7604.c, adv7842.c all
  devm_kzalloc their main state struct despite setting
  V4L2_SUBDEV_FL_HAS_DEVNODE too).
- "unregistering the subdev before disabling IRQ/work in remove()
  leaves sd->devnode dangling" -- checked the core:
  v4l2_device_unregister_subdev() only marks sd->devnode unregistered
  via video_unregister_device(), it does not free it; the struct is
  freed later via kref on last close, so the pointer stays valid.
- the residual "ioctl reschedules hpd_delayed_work concurrently with
  remove()" race -- real in the abstract (requires an ioctl already
  in flight at the exact moment of unbind), but no peer driver adds
  extra synchronization for this either (none set sd->devnode->lock),
  and the v2 fix (unregister first in remove()) already narrowed this
  down to the same residual risk level every peer driver carries.

Changes in v2:
- Fix premature v4l2_async_register_subdev(): move it to the end of
  probe() (after ctrl handler, CEC and initial hardware setup), and
  mirror the unregister order at the top of remove(), closing a
  use-after-free window where a concurrent ioctl could reschedule
  hpd_delayed_work during teardown.
- Take it6625_lock around the banked register reads in
  it6625_get_detected_timings() and the CEC RX path in
  it6625_cec_handler(), which could otherwise race with an in-progress
  EDID read/write and observe the wrong bank.
- Fix it6625_wait_for_status()'s poll interval exceeding the timeout
  budget, split the CEC RX/TX interrupt handling out of an else-if so
  simultaneous events aren't dropped, and wait for hardware to latch
  the CEC transmit trigger bit before releasing the lock.
- Stop it6625_set_fmt() from mutating active state on
  V4L2_SUBDEV_FORMAT_TRY, and handle edid->blocks == 0 in g_edid/s_edid
  per the V4L2 spec (capacity query / EDID clear).
- Zero-initialize the CEC rxmsg and debugfs mipi_reg write buffer to
  avoid leaking uninitialized stack bytes, and use designated
  initializers in the i2c_device_id table.

+	  CSI-2 bridge chips. IT6625 accepts an HDMI 2.0 input and
+	  IT6626 an HDMI 2.1 input, converting it to a MIPI CSI-2
+	  output. The driver also exposes an HDMI CEC adapter.
+
+	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
