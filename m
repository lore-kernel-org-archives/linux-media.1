Syzbot reports (whether it is of a lockdep or WARN spat) are also
non-determinstic.  Even when it claims to have a reproducer, the
reproducer is not neecessarily reliable.  I think the difference is
that we know what to expect with syzbot, and LLM reviews are new.

And as others have recently pointed out, there is a combination of
very deep subtle, real bugs that humans would not or have not
discovered --- and at the same time, hallucinations that aren't real.
So it's been hard to calibrate whether or not a particular report from
Sashiko is valid or not.  But this is nothing new, and I would claim
that it's not necessarily unique to LLM's.

Syzbot and oss-fuzz has been an extra burden on us as well.  I suspect
how much each tool impacts each subsystem varies, but I've had *way*
more syzbot false positives (e.g., reports that don't conform to our
threat models, such as reproducers using root privileges to modify the
loop device out from under a file system being reported as a "security
bug") than with Sashiko.  But it seems pretty clear that each
subsystem's experience has had different experiences with differnt
tools.

Sashiko is open source as well, and there are a number of ways of
fixing this, including adding annotations to the source code, etc.

Sure, figuring out prompts is tricky, but I'd argue so is making
changes to Clang for its context analysis.  Fortunately, there are
people who are smarter than me in terms of their Clang-fu who have
been improving Clang.  Similarly, Roman and his team are working on
improving Sashiko.  I don't think anyone has said that kernel
developers are responsible for changing the prompts (or changing
syzbot, Coverity, etc.)

Cheers,
