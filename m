I'd even go as far as questioning if the additional work is resulting in
less time being spent on changes that would address classes of problems.
There are many areas in the kernel where APIs are hard to use correctly.
Improvements there (and I know there's ongoing work such as Kees' object
allocator functions for instance) may pay off better than spending time
discussing about one-time memory leaks in error paths of probe
functions.
