Lockdep warnings are particularly tricky and hard to fix. We did
have false-positive lockdep warnings ("hallucinations") in the past
at subsystem level, which took years and a lot of work to find better
ways to fix them.

Agreed.

Just like any tool, LLM can produce very wrong or very good results
depending on how one uses it. I'm pretty much convinced that media
needs a custom set of prompts to avoid it to report false positives
and to make it point things that are more relevant to us.
