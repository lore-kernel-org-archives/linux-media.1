A wrinkle we will have to iron out is kind of the opposite problem, to
make sure that while guest_memfd thinks a range of offsets (PAGE_SIZE or
larger) is CoCo-private, the PFNs in that range must not be mapped
anywhere else in the host, or IOMMU.

One of the options I was thinking of was to seal off the template fd,
perhaps with an inode flag like S_IMMUTABLE, but not even allow reads,
and unlike S_IMMUTABLE, the (new) flag must not be changeable by
userspace.

Another option would be to just close the template fd so it'll not be
used, and the PFNs behind that template fd would just be completely in
guest_memfd ownership.

All non-guest_memfd paths to access the PFNs must be closed off, or
perhaps more precisely, any path that is not checked for
CoCo-shared/private status before building page table entries must be
closed off.

For CoCo-shared memory as tracked by guest_memfd (or non-CoCo, which
would use SHARED), the PFNs can still be mmap()-ed and actually set up
in userspace page tables.

Then, to use CoCo-shared memory for IO, IOMMUFD would also have to take
the guest_memfd (which IOMMUFD probably has to do, for CoCo-private
memory for Confidential IO, since CoCo-private memory can't be mapped to
userspace). Perhaps through IOMMU_IOAS_MAP_FILE?

In the process of mapping, IOMMUFD would tell guest_memfd "I have some
of your PFNs mapped.", and when guest_memfd gets a private->shared
conversion request, guest_memfd would get IOMMUFD to drop the
mappings. (perhaps some kind of MMU notifier setup)

Do you plan to use this for non-CoCo?

If we go with the above, IOMMUFD would get PFNs from guest_memfd instead
of dma-buf.

If each provider provides a .get_pfn() op, guest_memfd's
kvm_gmem_get_pfn() would try the first provider's .get_pfn() and if that
errors out, try the next one.

guest_memfd today uses a standard struct address_space to track the
pages that it owns. guest_memfd will have to use something else that can
track both pages and PFNs, and probably which provider it came from.

The more you probe me, the more complicated it's sounding. :) Still
worth pursuing if it's good to have though.

Handling that within a provider could be nice too, so instead of
guest_memfd trying .get_pfn()s in series, the provider will try a
hard-coded pair/list of PFN sources and then deal with the complexity
on behalf guest_memfd?

The flipside is for every combination of providers, the owner of the
virtualization service would have to maintain a custom kernel module for
the managing pages?

Maybe the flipside isn't too bad, actually, to provide more flexibility.

Will the VMM be doing a PUNCH_HOLE on the dma-buf fd or guest_memfd to
actually reclaim the page, or do you have something else in mind?
