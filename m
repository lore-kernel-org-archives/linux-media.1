About 20 drivers currently in Media tree use this "unneeded" macro in this
context. (These either have #ifdefs, __maybe_unused or depend on ACPI
directly, and the two first then can be removed after the two first patches
in the series.)

The rest of the reasoning you provided above is rather improbable IMHO.

These are often device specific and typically, albeit not always, there's
one device (especially camera sensors etc.) of a kind in a system.

Kernel documentation appears not to recognise such a tag. This can always
be found in lore though.
