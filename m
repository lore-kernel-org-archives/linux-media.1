I did not want us to discourse into side philosophical arguments about 
how and why the code base got to where it is. The story at hand is much 
simpler and narrower so excuse me for skipping the majority of the below.

Put in a different wording, what I was trying to express is this: Lets 
not write a poor commit message because the original one was poor. Aka 
two wrongs do not make a right.

Also, I am not putting a burden of proof on you, in fact, I offered to 
test your series.

As to your closing question to what I suggest commit message needs to 
add, that is simple, and yes, the first bullet point you list is what I 
have already asked for in one of the previous replies. So say something 
along the lines of:

"""
drm_sched_entity_error(), which is significantly used from various 
stages of the amdgpu job submit path, either directly or via 
amdgpu_vm_generation(), is changed from lockless to taking the 
entity->lock. As performance was not listed as a reason the lockless 
approach was chosen in the above referenced commit, although it is 
suspected that might have been the motivation, it is now thought that 
the new lock cycles to those paths will not add any measurable overhead.

For other drivers no new lock cycles are added to the submit path, given 
drm_sched_entity_select_rq() via the job arm path already bails out 
early due all drivers apart from AMD only passing a single scheduler 
list to the entity.
"""

Bonus point if you can spend the time to count how many extra 
lock-unlock cycles it is adding between it's CS submit, prepare job and 
run job entry points.

For me, that is not the burden of proof but some minimum standard of a 
commit message which shows some due diligence was done.

Tvrtko
