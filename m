For authors who object to generative AI, yes. And most likely for junior
developers too, see below.

I had noticed that :-)

For the time being I'm not seeing this as a viable option in any way, so
I'm not calling for it.

The discussion regarding enabling sashiko for the linux-media mailing
list started with the question of whether or not authors should be
CC'ed. This came from a consideration on the impact of false positives
and other hallucinations on junior developers. They may have the best
context of the work, but they are also most at risk of not questioning
the validity of the reviews. A one-size-fits-them-all approach may not
be good, which is why I think some sort of opt-in option could address
many concerns. I don't expect immediate and universal enthousiasm
though.

My comment wasn't about signing off patches. I was questioning whether
the time that sashiko saves for a maintainer is smaller, similar, or
larger than the time it takes to triage the comments. If the tool saves
maintainers from having to review some of the code, or from considering
some classes of problems in their reviews, would triaging the comments
come even close to the time saved ?
