That's actually a point against Sashiko. I can maintain a mental score of=20
different humans, their past review comments and behaviour, and other=20
contextual things like the time of day of their response.

It's really hard to do that with a bot like Sashiko, which can show two=20
extremes (even in the same review):

1. Find insane(ly good) security bugs that other humans missed
2. Hallucinate code that doesn't exist, or give false positives=20
goose-chases [1][2] that make sense if you read the code like prose, but=20
miss key details or context

Which makes me extra cautious and thorough when going through LLM generated=
=20
reviews compared to a human reviewer I trust.

Later in this thread you've equated Sashiko to static-analyzer tools=20
instead of humans (which is a bit convenient).

IMO false positives are possible everywhere, but LLMs are unpredictable in =

a very different way compared to static-analysis tools *especially* because=
=20
they can be quite good at finding some issues and are non-deterministic.

I can understand the appeal of using them to find security bugs or as extra=
=20
"eye balls to make all bugs shallow". And I am not advocating AI as bad or =

to ban it. But I do think usage of LLMs through Sashiko may give us free=20
reviews, but require brand new work of reviewing the reviews. And this new =

work will be a burden on experienced folks, not newcomers, who will simply =

believe the LLM output because it is (or sounds) smarter than them.

[2] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260715174326.0E5B51F00A3A@smtp.kernel.org/

See the pm_rumtime_put() suggestions above. Some people started giving the =

same review comments after possibly seeing Sashiko comments.

But on deeper inspection it turned out to be a false-positive:
lore.kernel.org/all/178080367434.9570.8101421417305606672@freya

My point isn't that static-analysis tools can't make the same mistake, but =

that they're open source and fixable in a way that current architecture of =

LLM models isn't in general, other than giving it an ever-increasing prompt=
=20
and hoping the random-number generator gods bless me when I need them to.

Thanks,
Jai

PS: There is a separate issue of how LF is advocating closed-weights paid=20
models trained on public data, just because it is free (as in beer) today=20
for *them* because they're a big organization. That demotivates a lot of=20
people (including me) who like working on open source projects because=20
they're open to inspect and tinker with.

Unfortunately if the "my way or the highway" approach is pushed too much,=20
the kernel might end up with a lot of free Gemini tokens but not many=20
enthusiastic humans to use them :-)

I've personally stopped using closed-weights model for anything, but=20
somehow now required to interact with one while working on the biggest open=
=20
source project in the world?? Maybe LF hasn't gotten the memo on how good=20
the open-weights models are these days, so I'll stop my whining here and=20
wait for a few months ;-)
