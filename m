It looks like dma_buf_dynamic_attach() actually takes the dma_resv lock
to update the attachment list, so that should work. Provided we want to
take existing attachments into account already at this stage.

Need to take care, though, not to have the resv lock held over the ops-

Something like this sounds OK, although given Jason's use-case, I added
some comments:


> attach =3D dma_buf_mapping_attach(...)
>=20

Just filter out impossible mappings.

> 2. Takes dmabuf->resv lock.

dma_buf_match_mapping_type(); Determines a mapping that is valid until
the next invalidate_mappings(). NOP if a valid mapping already exists.
Allows masking mapping_types.
This allows Jason's use-case while keeping the attachment as a
callback anchor.

>=20
> 3. Pins the attachment (if required):

dma_buf_match_mapping_type(); Determines a mapping that is valid until
the next invalidate_mappings(). NOP if a valid mapping already exists.
Allows masking mapping_types.
This allows Jason's use-case while keeping the attachment as a
callback anchor.

>=20
> rc =3D dma_buf_pin(attach)

This would implicitly pin also the mapping_type, but question is what
happens if a link is severed? Then we'd want an invalidate_mappings()
to re-negotiate the mapping type, but a pinned dma-buf that receives an
invalidate_mappings() is revoked by definition.

Since the resv is locked, nothing could have changed since
dma_buf_match_mapping_type();
